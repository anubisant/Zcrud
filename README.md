# What is zCrud?

zCrud is a javascript API (also works as jQuery plugin) used to create AJAX based CRUD tables without coding HTML or Javascript. It is based on 
 [jTable](http://www.jtable.org) with some major changes:
 
 * The heaviest change is to build all HTML code of forms using a template engine ([ZPT-JS](https://github.com/davidcana/ZPT-JS/wiki)). 
 * It does not depend on any javascript API (like jQueryUI), only on jQuery.
 * It does not create any dialog form, only simple HTML forms.
 
The next list details the features of jTable and the expected version of zCrud that will implement it:

* Automatically creates HTML table and loads records from server using AJAX. *(done!)*
* Creates 'create new record' form. When user creates a record, it sends data to server using AJAX and adds the same record to the table in the page. *(done!)*
* Creates 'edit record' form. When user edits a record, it updates server using AJAX and updates all cells on the table in the page. *(done!)*
* Creates 'delete a record' form. When user deletes a record, it deletes the record from server using AJAX and deletes the record from the table in the page. *(done!)*
* All tables and forms are created using templates.  It is also possible to use customized templates. The template engine is [ZPT-JS](https://github.com/davidcana/ZPT-JS). *(done!)*
* Makes it easy to customize already implemented form field types; also to add new form field types. *(done!)*
* All styling of table and forms are defined in a CSS file, so you can easily change style of everything to use plugin in your pages. CSS file is well defined and commented. *(done!)*
* It comes with pre-defined color themes. *(done!)*
* Supports server side sorting, paging and filtering using AJAX. *(done!)*
* Supports master/child tables. *(done!)*
* Allows user to select rows. *(done!)*
* It is not depended on any server side technology. *(done!)*
* It uses validation of forms support using [jQuery Form Validator](http://www.formvalidator.net/). Exposes some events to enable custom validation. *(done!)*
* Built-in support for english and spanish (full I18n and L10n support). Other languages can be added easily. *(done!)*
